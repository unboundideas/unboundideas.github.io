# Welcome to Open

Open is a community-driven, global collaboration platform that facilitates the submission and development of ideas using open-source principles and a fair licensing system for assigning ownership based on individual contributions. Our goal is to solve the problem of wasted talent by creating a more efficient and effective way to innovate and create new products and services through multi-tiered collaboration on a global scale.
